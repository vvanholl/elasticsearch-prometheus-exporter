# At this moment this is mostly smoke test only. The goal is the have a test to verify
# that metrics are relevant to specific ES node only but it seems that
# current esplugin does not support for communication with specific ES nodes
# only (see below for more details).
#
# Going forward one possible solution would be to implement this in Java similarly
# to PrometheusResponseIntegTestCase in PR#64:
# https://github.com/vvanholl/elasticsearch-prometheus-exporter/pull/64/files#diff-f91e6938f65298463b1935f9311d5e13
